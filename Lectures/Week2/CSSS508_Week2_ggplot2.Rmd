# But First...
## *Some useful stuff*

---

# Comments

You may have noticed that sometimes I have written code that looks like this:
```{r}
new.object <- 1:10 # Making vector of 1 to 10 
```
`#` is known as the *commenting symbol* in R!

Anything written on the same line *after* `#` will not be run by R.

This is useful for annotating your code to remind you (or others) what you are doing in a section.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
In R Markdown documents, comments only work in chunks. Outside of a chunk, `#` creates **headers** like "comments" at the top of this slide.
]

---

# Saving Files

You can save an R object on your computer as a file to open later:
```{r}
save(new.object, file="new_object.RData")
```

--

You can open saved files in R as well:
```{r}
load("new_object.RData")
```

--

But where are these files being saved and loaded from?

---

# Working Directories

R saves files and looks for files to open in your current **working directory**<sup>1</sup>. You
can ask R what this is:

.footnote[[1] For a simple R function to open an Explorer / Finder window at your working directory, [see this StackOverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12135823/10277284).]

```{r}
getwd()
```

--

Similarly, we can set a working directory like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/cclan/Documents")
```

--

*Don't set a working directory in R Markdown documents!* They automatically set the directory they are in as the working directory.

---

# Managing Files

When managing R projects, it is normally best to give each project (such as a homework
assignment) its own folder. I use the following system:

--

* Every class or project has its own folder
--

* Each assignment or task has a folder inside that, which is the working directory for that item.
--

* `.Rmd` and `.R` files are named clearly and completely

--

For example, this presentation is located and named this:
`GitHub/CSSS508/Lectures/Week2/CSSS508_Week2_ggplot2.Rmd`

--

You can use whatever system you want, but be consistent so your projects are organized! 
You don't want to lose work by losing or overwriting files!

--

For large projects containing many files, I recommend using RStudio's built in project management system found in the top right of the RStudio window.

--

For journal articles I recommend Ben Marwick's [`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) and [`huskydown`](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) for UW dissertations and theses. [I made an `rrtools` demo presentation here](https://clanfear.github.io/birthtiming/inst/presentation/presentation.html#/).

---

# File Types

We mainly work with three types of file in this class:

--

* `.Rmd`: These are **markdown** *syntax* files, where you write code to *make documents*.

--

* `.R`: These are **R** *syntax* files, where you write code to process and analyze data *without making an output document*.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] While beyond the scope of this class, you can use the `source()` function to run a `.R` script file inside a `.Rmd` or `.R` file. Using this you can break a large project up into multiple files but still run it all at once!]

--

* `.html` or `.pdf`: These are the output documents created when you *knit* a markdown document.

--

Make sure you understand the difference between the uses of these file types! Please
ask for clarification if needed!

# Data and Subsetting

---

# Gapminder Data

We'll be working with data from Hans Rosling's [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) project.
An excerpt of these data can be accessed through an R package called `gapminder`, cleaned and assembled by Jenny Bryan at UBC.

--

In the console: `install.packages("gapminder")`

Load the package and data:
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

---

# Check Out Gapminder

The data frame we will work with is called `gapminder`, available once you have loaded the package. Let's see its structure:

.small[
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
]

---

# What's Interesting Here?

* **Factor** variables `country` and `continent`

   + Factors are categorical data with an underlying numeric representation
   + We'll spend a lot of time on factors later!

--

* Many observations: $n=`r nrow(gapminder)`$ rows

--

* A nested/hierarchical structure: `year` in `country` in `continent`

   + These are panel data!

---
class: inverse

# Subsetting Data


---

# Installing Tidyverse

We'll want to be able to slice up this data frame into subsets (e.g. just the rows for Afghanistan, just the rows for 1997).

We will use a package called `dplyr` to do this neatly.

`dplyr` is part of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) family of R packages that are the focus of this course.

--

If you have not already installed the tidyverse, type, in the console: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

--

This will install a *large* number of R packages we will use throughout the term, including `dplyr`.

`dplyr` is a very useful and powerful package that we will talk more about soon, but today we're just going to use it for "filtering" data.

---

# Loading dplyr

```{r, message=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
```

---

# Wait, was that an error?

When you load packages in R that have functions sharing the same name as functions you already have, the more recently loaded functions overwrite the previous ones ("masks them").

--

This **message** is just letting you know that. To avoid showing this in your R Markdown file, add `message=FALSE` or `include=FALSE` to your chunk options when loading packages.

--

Sometimes you may get a **warning message** when loading packages---usually because you aren't running the latest version of R:

```
Warning message:
package `gapminder' was built under R version 3.4.1 
```
Chunk options `message=FALSE` or `include=FALSE` will hide this. *Update R* to deal with it completely!

---

# `magrittr` and Pipes

`dplyr` allows us to use `magrittr`<sup>1</sup> operators (`%>%`) to "pipe" data between functions. So instead of nesting functions like this:

.footnote[[1] [Ceci n'est pas un pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)]

```{r}
log(mean(gapminder$pop))
```

--

We can pipe them like this:

```{r}
gapminder$pop %>% mean() %>% log()
```

--

Read this as, "send `gapminder$pop` to `mean()`, then send the output of that to `log()`."
In essence, pipes read "left to right" while nested functions read "inside to out."
This may be confusing... we'll cover it more later!

---

# `filter` Data Frames

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Oman")
```

What is this doing?

---

# Logical Operators

We used `==` for testing "equals": `country == "Oman"`.

--

There are many other [logical operators](http://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html):

--

* `!=`: not equal to
--

* `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to, etc.
--

* `%in%`: used with checking equal to one of several values

--

Or we can combine multiple logical conditions:

* `&`: both conditions need to hold (AND)
--

* `|`: at least one condition needs to hold (OR)
--

* `!`: inverts a logical condition (`TRUE` becomes `FALSE`, `FALSE` becomes `TRUE`)

--

We'll use these a lot so don't worry too much right now!

---

# Multiple Conditions Example

Let's say we want observations from Oman after 1980 and through 2000.

--

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Oman" &
           year > 1980 &
           year <= 2000 )
```

---

# Saving a Subset

If we think a particular subset will be used repeatedly, we can save it and give it a name like any other object:

```{r}
China <- gapminder %>% filter(country == "China")
head(China, 4)
```

# `ggplot2`

An alternative way of plotting many prefer (myself included)<sup>1</sup> uses the `ggplot2` package in R, which is part of the `tidyverse`.

.footnote[[1] [Though this is not without debate](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/)]

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

The core idea underlying this package is the [**layered grammar of graphics**](https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098): we can break up elements of a plot into pieces and combine them.

# Structure of a ggplot

`ggplot2` graphics objects consist of two primary components:

--

1. **Layers**, the components of a graph.

   * We *add* layers to a `ggplot2` object using `+`.
   * This includes lines, shapes, and text.

--

2. **Aesthetics**, which determine how the layers appear.

   * We *set* aesthetics using *arguments* (e.g. `color="red"`) inside layer functions.
   * This includes locations, colors, and sizes.
   * Aesthetics also determine how data *map* to appearances.

---

# Layers

**Layers** are the components of the graph, such as:

* `ggplot()`: initializes `ggplot2` object, specifies input data
* `geom_point()`: layer of scatterplot points
* `geom_line()`: layer of lines
* `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`: layers of labels
* `facet_wrap()`: layer creating separate panels stratified by some factor wrapping around
* `facet_grid()`: same idea, but can split by two variables along rows and columns (e.g. `facet_grid(gender ~ age_group)`)
* `theme_bw()`: replace default gray background with black-and-white

Layers are separated by a `+` sign. For clarity, I usually put each layer on a new line, unless it takes few or no arguments (e.g. `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `theme_bw()`).

---

# Aesthetics

**Aesthetics** control the appearance of the layers:

* `x`, `y`: $x$ and $y$ coordinate values to use
* `color`: set color of elements based on some data value
* `group`: describe which points are conceptually grouped together for the plot (often used with lines)
* `size`: set size of points/lines based on some data value
* `alpha`: set transparency based on some data value

---

## Aesthetics: Setting vs. mapping

Layers take arguments to control their appearance, such as point/line colors or transparency (`alpha` between 0 and 1).

--

* Arguments like `color`, `size`, `linetype`, `shape`, `fill`, and `alpha` can be used directly on the layers (**setting aesthetics**), e.g. `geom_point(color = "red")`. See the [`ggplot2` documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html) for options. These *don't depend on the data*.

--

* Arguments inside `aes()` (**mapping aesthetics**) will *depend on the data*, e.g. `geom_point(aes(color = continent))`.

--

* `aes()` in the `ggplot()` layer gives overall aesthetics to use in other layers, but can be changed on individual layers (including switching `x` or `y` to different variables)

--

This may seem pedantic, but precise language makes searching for help easier.

---

# Storing Plots

We can assign a `ggplot` object to a name:

```{r}
lifeExp_by_year <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Life expectancy") +
    ggtitle("Life expectancy over time") +
    theme_bw()
```

The graph won't be displayed when you do this. You can show the graph using a single line of code with just the object name, *or take the object and add more layers*.

---

# Showing a Stored Graph

```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
lifeExp_by_year
```

---

## Adding a Layer

```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
lifeExp_by_year +
    geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

---

# Tinkering Suggestions

Start experimenting with making some graphs in `ggplot2` of the Gapminder data. You can look at a subset of the data using `filter()` to limit rows, plot different $x$ and $y$ variables, facet by a factor, etc.

Some other options:

* `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, `geom_boxplot()` (see the [Cookbook for R site](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_%28ggplot2%29/) for a reference)

* `geom_smooth()` for adding loess or regression lines (see the [`ggplot2` documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_smooth.html))

* Install [Jeff Arnold's `ggthemes` package](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes), load it, and try `theme_economist()`, `theme_stata()`, `theme_excel()` instead of no theme or `theme_bw()`

---

## Common Problem: Overplotting

Often we want a scatterplot of things that have discrete units. All those dots plot over each other!

.small[
```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = year, color = continent)) +
    geom_point()
```
]
---

## Fixing Overplotting with Jitter

Inside `geom_point()`, `position = position_jitter(width=a, height=b)` shifts points up to `a` units horizontally and `b` units vertically.

.small[
```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = year, color = continent)) +
    geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 2))
```
]
---

# Changing the Axes

We can modify the axes in a variety of ways, such as:

* Change the $x$ or $y$ range using `xlim()` or `ylim()` layers

* Change to a logarithmic or square-root scale on either axis: `scale_x_log10()`, `scale_y_sqrt()`

* Change where the major/minor breaks are: `scale_x_continuous(breaks =, minor_breaks = )`

---

# Axis Changes

```{r, fig.height=3.5, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = China, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000)) + #<<
    xlim(1940, 2010) + ggtitle("Chinese GDP per capita")
```

---

# Fonts Too Small?

```{r, fig.height=3.5, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = China, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Chinese life expectancy") +
    theme_gray(base_size = 20) #<<
```

---

# Text and Tick Adjustments

Text size, labels, tick marks, etc. can be messed with more precisely using arguments to the `theme()` layer. 

Examples:

* `plot.title = element_text(size = rel(2), hjust = 0)` makes the title twice as big as usual and left-aligns it
* `axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)` rotates $x$ axis labels
* `axis.text = element_text(colour = "blue")` makes the $x$ and $y$ axis labels blue
* `axis.ticks.length = unit(.5, "cm")` makes the axis ticks longer

Note: `theme()` is a different layer than `theme_gray()` or `theme_bw()`, which you might also be using in a previous layer. See the [`ggplot2` documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/theme.html) for details. 

I recommend using `theme()` *after* `theme_bw()` or other *global themes*.

---

# Scales for Color, Shape, etc.

**Scales** are layers that control how the mapped aesthetics appear. You can modify these with a `scale_[aesthetic]_[option]()` layer where `[aesthetic]` is `color`, `shape`, `linetype`, `alpha`, `size`, `fill`, etc. and `[option]` is something like `manual`, `continuous` or `discrete` (depending on nature of the variable).

Examples:
* `scale_linetype_manual()`: manually specify the linetype for each different value
* `scale_alpha_continuous()`: varies transparency over a continuous range
* `scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")`: uses a palette from <http://colorbrewer2.org> (great site for picking nice plot colors!)

When confused... Google or StackOverflow it!

---

## Legend Name and Manual Colors
.small[
```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
lifeExp_by_year + 
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Which\ncontinent\nare we\nlooking at?", # \n adds a line break #<<
    values = c("Africa" = "seagreen", "Americas" = "turquoise1", 
               "Asia" = "royalblue", "Europe" = "violetred1", "Oceania" = "yellow"))
```
]
---

## Fussy Manual Legend Example Code
.small[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = "Country", size = "Country")) +
    geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = "loess", #<<
          aes(group = continent, color = "Continent", size = "Continent"), alpha = 0.5) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) + #<<
    scale_color_manual(name = "Life Exp. for:", #<<
                       values = c("Country" = "black", "Continent" = "blue")) + #<<
    scale_size_manual(name = "Life Exp. for:", 
                      values = c("Country" = 0.25, "Continent" = 3)) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + 
    ylab("Years") + xlab("") + 
    ggtitle("Life Expectancy, 1952-2007", subtitle = "By continent and country") +
    theme(legend.position=c(0.75, 0.2), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) #<<
```
]

Wow, there's a lot going on here!
* Two different `geom_line()` calls
   + One of them draws a [*loess* curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression)
* `facet_wrap()` to make a plot for each level of `continent`
* Manual scales for size and color
* Custom labels, titles, and rotated x axis text

## Fussy Manual Legend

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = "Country", size = "Country")) +
    geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = "loess", aes(group = continent, color = "Continent", size = "Continent"), alpha = 0.5) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) +
    scale_color_manual(name = "Life Exp. for:", values = c("Country" = "black", "Continent" = "blue")) +
    scale_size_manual(name = "Life Exp. for:", values = c("Country" = 0.25, "Continent" = 3)) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + ylab("Years") + xlab("") + ggtitle("Life Expectancy, 1952-2007", subtitle = "By continent and country") +
    theme(legend.position=c(0.75, 0.2), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

Observation: One could use `filter()` to identify the countries with dips in life expectancy and investigate.

Know Your History: What happened in Africa in the early 1990s and Asia in the mid-1970s that might reduce life expectancy suddenly *for one country*?

## More on Customizing Legends

You can move the legends around, flip their orientation, remove them altogether, etc. The [Cookbook for R website](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_%28ggplot2%29) is my go-to for burning questions such as how to change the legend labels.

# Saving `ggplot` Plots

When you knit an R Markdown file, any plots you make are automatically saved in the "figure" folder in `.png` format. If you want to save another copy (perhaps of a different file type for use in a manuscript), use `ggsave()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("I_saved_a_file.pdf", plot = lifeExp_by_year,
       height = 3, width = 5, units = "in")
```

If you didn't manually set font sizes, these will usually come out at a reasonable size given the dimensions of your output file.

**Bad/non-reproducible way**<sup>1</sup>: choose *Export* on the plot preview or take a screenshot / snip.

.footnote[[1] I still do this for quick emails of simple plots. Bad me!]

# Bonus Plot

`ggplot2` is well suited to making complex, publication ready plots.

This is the complete syntax for one plot from a recent article of mine.<sup>1</sup>

.small[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(estimated_pes, aes(x = Target, y = PE, group = Reporter)) + 
  facet_grid(`Crime Type` ~ Neighborhood) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LB, ymax = UB),
                position = position_dodge(width = .4), size = 0.75, width = 0.15) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, position = position_dodge(width = .4),
             size = 2, aes(fill = Reporter)) + 
  scale_fill_manual("Reporter",
                    values = c("Any White" = "white", "All Black" = "black")) +
  ggtitle("Figure 3. Probability of Arrest", 
          subtitle = "by Reporter and Target Race, Neighborhood and Crime Type") +
  xlab("Race of Target") + ylab("Estimated Probability") + 
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = c(0.86, 0.15),
                     legend.background = element_rect(color = 1))
```

# Homework


Pick some relationship to look at in the Gapminder data and write up a .Rmd file investigating that question graphically. You might work with a subset of the data (e.g. just Africa). Upload both the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` file to Canvas. 

* Include 4 to 8 plots.
* All titles, axes, and legends should be labelled clearly (no raw variable names).
* You must have at least one graph with `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`.
* You must include at least one manually specified legend.
* You can use other `geoms` like histograms, bar charts, add vertical or horizontal lines, etc. [You may find this data visualization cheat sheet helpful](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf).

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization. You must write up your observations in words as well as showing the graphs. Use chunk options `echo` and `results` to limit the code/output you show in the `.html`.

# Data Today

We'll use data on food safety inspections in King County from [data.kingcounty.gov](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Health/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Data/f29f-zza5). 

Note these data are *fairly large*. You may want to save them and load them from a *local directory*.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("restaurants.Rdata")
```

.small[
```{r download_restaurant_data, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
restaurants <- 
  read_csv("https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/Lectures/Week8/restaurants.csv",
                        col_types = "ccccccccnnccicccciccciD") #<<
```
]

.footnote[I recommend specifying the column types so they read in correctly.]

# Strings

A general programming term for a unit of character data is a **string**, which is defined
as *a sequence of characters*. In R the terms "strings" and "character data" are mostly interchangeable.

--

In other languages, "string" often also refers to a *sequence* of numeric information, such as
binary strings (e.g. "01110000 01101111 01101111 01110000"). We rarely use these in R.

--

Note that these are *sequences* of numbers rather than single numbers, and thus *strings*. 

One thing that separates a string from a number is that the leading zeroes are meaningful: `01 != 1`

# String Basics

---
# `nchar()`

We've seen the `nchar()` function to get the number of characters in a string. How many characters are in the ZIP codes?

```{r nchar_zip}
restaurants %>% 
  mutate(ZIP_length = nchar(Zip_Code)) %>%
  count(ZIP_length)
```

---
# `substr()`

You should be familiar with `substr()` from the homeworks. We can use it to pull out just the first 5 digits of the ZIP code.

```{r substr}
restaurants <- restaurants %>%
    mutate(ZIP_5 = substr(Zip_Code, 1, 5))
restaurants %>% distinct(ZIP_5) %>% head()
```

---
# `paste()`

We can combine parts of strings together using the `paste()` function, e.g. to make a whole mailing address:

```{r mailing_address}
restaurants <- restaurants %>%
    mutate(mailing_address = 
           paste(Address, ", ", City, ", WA ", ZIP_5, sep = ""))
restaurants %>% distinct(mailing_address) %>% head()
```

---
# `paste0()`

`paste0()` is a shortcut for `paste()` without any separator.

```{r paste0}
paste(1:5, letters[1:5]) # sep is a space by default
paste(1:5, letters[1:5], sep ="")
paste0(1:5, letters[1:5])
```

---
# `paste()` Practice

`sep=` controls what happens when doing entry-wise squishing of vectors you give to `paste()`, while `collapse=` controls if/how they go from a vector to a single string.

Here are some examples; make sure you understand how each set of arguments produce their results:

```{r paste_practice, eval=TRUE, results="hold"}
paste(letters[1:5], collapse = "!")
paste(1:5, letters[1:5], sep = "+")
paste0(1:5, letters[1:5], collapse = "???")
paste(1:5, "Z", sep = "*")
paste(1:5, "Z", sep = "*", collapse = " ~ ")
```

# `stringr`

.img-full[![](img/stringer.jpg)]

---
# `stringr`

`stringr` is yet another R package from the Tidyverse (like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`, `readr`).

It provides functions that:

* Replace some basic string functions like `paste()` and `nchar()` in a way that's a bit less touchy with missing values or factors
* Remove whitespace or pad it out
* Perform tasks related to **pattern matching**: Detect, locate, extract, match, replace, split.
    + These functions use **regular expressions** to describe patterns
    + Base R and `stringi` versions for these exist but are harder to use

Conveniently, *most* `stringr` functions begin with "`str_`" to make RStudio auto-complete more useful.
    
```{r load_stringr}
library(stringr)
```

---
# `stringr` Equivalencies

* `str_sub()` is like `substr()` but also lets you put in negative values to count backwards from the end (-1 is the end, -3 is third from end):

```{r str_sub_example}
str_sub("Washington", 1, -3)
```
--

* `str_c()` ("string combine") is just like `paste()` but where the default is `sep = ""` (like `paste0()`)

```{r str_c_example}
str_c(letters[1:5], 1:5)
```

---
# `stringr` Equivalencies

* `str_length()` is equivalent to `nchar()`:

```{r nchar_v_str_length}
nchar("weasels")
str_length("weasels")
```

---
# Changing Cases

`str_to_upper()`, `str_to_lower()`, `str_to_title()` convert cases, which is often a good idea to do before searching for values:

```{r make_seattle_uppercase}
head(unique(restaurants$City))
restaurants <- restaurants %>%
    mutate_at(vars(Name, Address, City), ~str_to_upper(.))
head(unique(restaurants$City))
```

---
# `str_trim()` Whitespace

Extra leading or trailing whitespace is common in text data:

```{r show_whitespace}
head(unique(restaurants$Name), 4)
```

--

Any character column is potentially affected. We can use the `str_trim()` function in `stringr` to clean them up all at once:

```{r clean_whitespace}
# use mutate_if to trim all the character columns
restaurants <- restaurants %>% mutate_if(is.character, str_trim) #<<
head(unique(restaurants$Name), 4)
```

.footnote[`mutate_if(x, y)` applies function `y` to every column for which `x` is `TRUE`.]

# Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching

---
# What are Regular Expressions?

**Regular expressions** or **regex**es are how we describe patterns we are looking for
in text in a way that a computer can understand. We write an **expression**, apply it
to a string input, and then can do things with **matches** we find.

--

* **Literal characters** are defined snippets to search for like `SEA` or `206`

--

* **Metacharacters** let us be flexible in describing patterns:
    + backslash `\`, caret `^`, dollar sign `$`, period `.`, pipe `|`, question mark `?`, asterisk `*`, plus sign `+`, parentheses `(` and `)`, square brackets `[` and `]`, curly braces `{` and `}`
    + To treat a metacharacter as a literal character, you must **escape** it with two preceding backslashs `\\`, e.g. to match `(206)` including the parentheses, you'd use `\\(206\\)` in your regex

---
# `str_detect()`

I want to get inspections for coffee shops. I'll say a coffee shop is anything that has "COFFEE", "ESPRESSO", or "ROASTER" in the name. The `regex` for this is `COFFEE|ESPRESSO|ROASTER` because `|` is a metacharacter that means "OR". Use the `str_detect()` function, which returns `TRUE` if it finds what you're looking for and `FALSE` if it doesn't (similar to `grepl()`):

```{r coffee_check}
coffee <- restaurants %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Name, "COFFEE|ESPRESSO|ROASTER"))
coffee %>% distinct(Name) %>% head()
```

---
# Will My Coffee Kill Me?

Let's take each unique business identifier, keep the most recent inspection score, and look at a histogram of scores:

.small[
```{r coffee_histogram, fig.height = 3, dev = "svg" }
coffee %>% select(Business_ID, Name, Inspection_Score, Date) %>%
       group_by(Business_ID) %>% filter(Date == max(Date)) %>% 
       distinct(.keep_all=TRUE) %>% ggplot(aes(Inspection_Score)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins=8) + xlab("Most recent inspection score") + ylab("") +
    ggtitle("Histogram of inspection scores for Seattle coffee shops")
```
]

---
# `str_detect()`: Patterns

Let's look for phone numbers whose first three digits are "206" using `str_detect()`.

We will want it to work whether they have parentheses around the beginning or not, but NOT to match "206" occurring elsewhere:

```{r look_for_206}
area_code_206_pattern <- "^\\(?206"
phone_test_examples <- c("2061234567", "(206)1234567",
                         "(206) 123-4567", "555-206-1234")
str_detect(phone_test_examples, area_code_206_pattern)
```

* `^` is a metacharacter meaning "look only at the *beginning* of the string"
* `\\(?` means look for a left parenthesis (`\\(`), but it's optional (`?`)
* `206` is the literal string to look for after the optional parenthesis



---
# `str_view()`

`stringr` also has a function called `str_view()` that allows you to see in the viewer pane *exactly*
what text is being selected with a regular expression.

```{r str_view, eval=FALSE}
str_view(phone_test_examples, area_code_206_pattern)
```

This will generate a small web page in the viewer pane (but not in Markdown docs).

Just be careful to not load an entire long vector / variable or it may crash RStudio
as it tries to render a massive page!

---
# How Many Rows Have Non-206 Numbers?

```{r look_for_206_rest}
restaurants %>% 
  mutate(has_206_number = 
           str_detect(Phone, area_code_206_pattern)) %>% 
  group_by(has_206_number) %>% tally()
```

`str_detect()` returns `NA` for rows with missing (`NA`) phone numbers--you can't search for text in a missing value.

---
# Extracting Patterns with `str_extract()`

Let's extract the [directional part of Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_layout_of_Seattle#Directionals) of addresses: N, NW, SE, none, etc.


```{r test_direction}
direction_pattern <- " (N|NW|NE|S|SW|SE|W|E)( |$)"
direction_examples <- c("2812 THORNDYKE AVE W", "512 NW 65TH ST",
                        "407 CEDAR ST", "15 NICKERSON ST")
str_extract(direction_examples, direction_pattern)
```

* The first space will match a space character, then
* `(N|NW|NE|S|SW|SE|W|E)` matches one of the directions in the group
* `( |$)` is a group saying either there is a space after, or it's the end of the address string (`$` means the end of the string)

---
# Where are the Addresses?

```{r extract_directions}
restaurants %>% 
  distinct(Address) %>% 
  mutate(city_region = 
          str_trim(str_extract(Address, direction_pattern))) %>% 
  count(city_region) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

---
# `str_replace()`: Replacing

Maybe we want to do a street-level analysis of inspections (e.g. compare The Ave to Pike Street). How can we remove building numbers?

```{r test_address_numbers}
address_number_pattern <- "^[0-9]*-?[A-Z]? (1/2 )?"
address_number_test_examples <- 
  c("2812 THORNDYKE AVE W", "1ST AVE", "10A 1ST AVE", 
    "10-A 1ST AVE", "5201-B UNIVERSITY WAY NE",
    "7040 1/2 15TH AVE NW")
str_replace(address_number_test_examples, 
            address_number_pattern, replacement = "")
```

---
# How Does the Building Number regex Work?

Let's break down `"^[0-9]*-?[A-Z]? (1/2 )?"`:

* `^[0-9]` means look for a digit between 0 and 9 (`[0-9]`) at the beginning (`^`)

--

* `*` means potentially match more digits after that

--

* `-?` means optionally (`?`) match a hyphen (`-`)

--

* `[A-Z]?` means optionally match (`?`) a letter (`[A-Z]`)

--

* Then we match a space (` `)

--

* `(1/2 )?` optionally matches a 1/2 followed by a space since this is apparently a thing with some address numbers

---
# Removing Street Numbers

```{r replace_numbers}
restaurants <- restaurants %>% 
  mutate(street_only = str_replace(Address, address_number_pattern,
                                   replacement = ""))
restaurants %>% distinct(street_only) %>% head(10)
```

---
# How About Units/Suites Too?

Getting rid of unit/suite references is tricky, but a decent attempt would be to drop anything including and after "#", "STE", "SUITE", "SHOP", "UNIT":

```{r test_unit_numbers}
address_unit_pattern <- " (#|STE|SUITE|SHOP|UNIT).*$"
address_unit_test_examples <-
  c("1ST AVE", "RAINIER AVE S #A", "FAUNTLEROY WAY SW STE 108", 
    "4TH AVE #100C", "NW 54TH ST")
str_replace(address_unit_test_examples, address_unit_pattern,
            replacement = "")
```

---
# How'd the Unit regex Work?

Breaking down `" (#|STE|SUITE|SHOP|UNIT).*$"`:

* First we match a space

--

* `(#|STE|SUITE|SHOP|UNIT)` matches one of those words

--

* `.*$` matches *any* character (`.`) after those words, zero or more times (`*`), until the end of the string (`$`)


---
# Removing Units/Suites

```{r replace_units}
restaurants <- restaurants %>% 
  mutate(street_only = str_trim(str_replace(street_only, 
                       address_unit_pattern, replacement = "")))
restaurants %>% distinct(street_only) %>% head(11)
```

.pull-right[.footnote[For serious work, we would want to also look into special cases like "C-08" here.]]

---
# Where Does Danger Lurk?

Let's get the number of 45+ point inspections occurring on every street.

```{r failed_inspections}
restaurants %>% 
  filter(Inspection_Score > 45) %>% 
  distinct(Business_ID, Date, Inspection_Score, street_only) %>% 
  count(street_only) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(n=5)
```

---
# Splitting up Strings

You can split up strings using `tidyr::separate()`, seen in Week 5. Another option is `str_split()`, which will split strings based on a pattern separating parts and put these components in a list. `str_split_fixed()` will do that but with a matrix instead (thus can't have varying numbers of separators):

.small[
```{r str_split_violation}
head(str_split_fixed(restaurants$Violation_Description, " - ", n = 2))
```
]

---
# Making Sentences

Maybe we have a report or website where we need text dynamically generated from data.

Lets prep some recent scores first.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
recent_scores <- restaurants %>%
  select(Name, Address, City, 
         Inspection_Score, Inspection_Date) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Inspection_Score)) %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Inspection_Score)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Name, Address, City), ~ str_to_title(.)) %>%
  mutate(Inspection_Date = mdy(Inspection_Date)) %>%
  sample_n(3)
```

---
## With `paste()`

We can give *many* arguments to string a sentence together.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(scales) # for ordinal day text
recent_scores %>%
  mutate(text_desc = 
           paste(Name, 
                 "is located at", Address, "in", City,
                 "and received a score of", Inspection_Score, "on",
                 month(Inspection_Date, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE),
                 paste0(ordinal(day(Inspection_Date)),","), 
                 paste0(year(Inspection_Date), "."))) %>% 
  select(text_desc)
```

---
## With `glue`

Or we can use `str_glue`, `paste()`'s more sophisticated sibling which uses [the `glue` package](https://glue.tidyverse.org/). Variables and functions just go inside `{ }` and you can create temporary variables for convenience.

```{r}
(score_text <- recent_scores %>%
  mutate(text_desc = 
           str_glue("{Name} is located at {Address} in {City} ",
                    "and received a score of {Inspection_Score} ",
                    "on {month(when, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE)} ",
                    "{ordinal(day(when))}, {year(when)}.",
                    when = Inspection_Date)) %>% 
  select(text_desc))
```

---
# `str_wrap()` and `\n`

The previous output will work fine for in-line Markdown, but it runs off the edge of the console. It also won't wrap in many tables and images.

We can add regular linebreaks using `str_wrap()` or manually with `"\n"`.

```{r}
score_text %>% 
  pull(text_desc) %>% 
  str_wrap(width = 70) %>% #<<
  paste0("\n\n") %>% # add two linebreaks as a paragraph break #<<
  cat() # cat combines text and prints it
```


---
# Other Useful `stringr` Functions

`str_pad(string, width, side, pad)`: Adds "padding" to any string to make it a given minimum width.

`str_subset(string, pattern)`: Returns all elements that contain matches of the pattern.

`str_which(string, pattern)`: Returns numeric indices of elements that match the pattern.

`str_replace_all(string, pattern, replacement)`: Performs multiple replacements simultaneously

`str_squish(string)`: Trims spaces around a string but also removes duplicate spaces inside it.

# Coming Up

Homework 6, Part 2 is due next week, and peer reviews due the week after.

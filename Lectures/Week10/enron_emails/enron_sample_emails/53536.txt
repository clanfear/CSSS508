 Have you considered joining a consultancy?

Bill,

Lacima is relatively small, but they have two very competent
and experienced principals: Chris Strickland and Les Clewlow.

I am looking right now at a number of options. Hopefully, I shall make a
decision
within a few weeks.

Vince

    Have you developed plans?  I'd be interested in your evaluation of
   Lakima
   Group, whom I believe you've worked with.  How big are they?

      Hi Vince -
      Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK
under
      the
      circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm
transitioning
   to
      an
      advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational
mode,
      rather
      than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the
Palo
      Alto
      office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to
extend
   an
      invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if
   our
      interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?


      Bill Balson
      Vice President

I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of 
interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc).

Dear Jeffrey,

I would like to follow up on the email regarding a personal invitation to 
join the Council of Energy Advisors that I recently sent you.

I wanted to see if there are any additional questions I can
answer. To reiterate, the Council is an organization of top engineers, 
corporate representatives, and energy experts that we pay(e.g. $250/hr) to 
consult via phone and email for our client base of more than 90 investment 
managers.

I feel that your background and expertise would be an asset to
the Council. Please feel free to register online at 
http://www.thecouncils.com/peapp.asp?copaid=75344579&invid=56 (just a quick 
5-minute form).  Also, you can learn more about our work at 
www.thecouncils.com.

Thanks for your consideration, I look forward to working with you. Again, 
please contact me anytime if if you have any remaining questions.

Best regards,
Matt

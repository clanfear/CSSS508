Philip,

Please, try Frank Wolak from Stanford University.

He is the best expert on California right now.

Vince

Thanks for coming back to me on this anyway. Would you be able to suggest
anyone else - either in Australia, Europe or US who would be good to get to
discuss the California crisis?

kind regards.

Philip

Philip,

I have to decline the invitation with regrets.
I have too many commitments right now.

   Dear Vince

   Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
   inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
   which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
   opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
   programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
   possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

   I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852
   2545
   2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.

   Kind regards.

   Philip

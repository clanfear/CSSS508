Joanna,

You can keep the name as is.
I don't want Zimin to be blamed for the flaws of my presentation.

Hello Vince!

Hope you are well.  Thank you for your presentations.  Just one question,
would you like me to change the name on the presentations from Vince to
Zimin, or should I leave them as is?

Please advise.

Take care

Joanna

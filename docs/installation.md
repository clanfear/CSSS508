# Installing R and RStudio

This document walks you through installing R and RStudio on your personal computer.

In the instructions below, anywhere it says (version), there will be a series of numbers such as `3.5.1`. The specific version does not matter, but we want to always use the most recent one.

## Installing R

  ### Windows

   1. Go to the [Windows Installers page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
    * Click `Download R (version)` to download: Whatever version is listed will be the most current.
   2. Run the installer.
    * If the installer asks, grant it administrative privileges to install.
    * Follow the on-screen instructions.
    * You do not need to change any default values unless you have a good reason.
   3. Once it completes, R is installed!
    * There may now be R icons on your desktop or start menu, but we typically do not use R directly.
